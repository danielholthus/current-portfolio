        <h3>Job Overview</h3>
        <p>
          My contributions at Hoamsy included many projects ranging from refactoring existing aspects of the platform’s UI, to implementing brand new features on the site. While at Hoamsy, I had significant exposure to tools such as source control (Github), Vue.js, Figma, and NoSQL databases. Below is just a few of the projects I worked on during my time there:

      <div class="section-content">
        <img src="./img/hoamsy-homepage.png" alt="screenshot of hoamsy.com homepage">
        <div>
          <h3>Home Page</h3>
          <p>I worked closely with Hoamsy's design team to implement reworks for different aspects of the Hoamsy homepage. As a growing startup, it was important to build a homepage that led to high click-through rates and user retention, and many design and development decisions were made with this in mind.</p>

      <div class="section-content reverse">
        <div>
          <h3>Contact Page</h3>
          <p>A rework of the contact page was my very first project at Hoamsy. This was the first of many exposures with CSS's flexbox while working on front-end projects at Hoamsy, as well as my first exposure with collaborating on UI & UX designs.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Feedback Page</h3>
          <p>While working on Hoamsy’s new contact page, I was also simultaneously working on the creation of a user feedback page for the platform. This was my first exposure to <i>full-stack</i> web development, and it required designing and coding the front-end interface as well as setting up the backend infrastructure to store each user’s inputs.</p>

      <div class="section-content reverse">
        <div>
          <h3>User Cards</h3>
          <p>After working on the contact and feedback pages, I worked on a total redesign of Hoamsy’s user cards. On this project, I again worked closely with the design team to create the basic layout and structure. <br><br>This specific project is where I learned to retrieve data from the platform’s database and Vue Store and then display that data dynamically and stylistically on the front-end of the website.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>User Onboarding</h3>
          <p>One of the more robust projects that I worked on while at Hoamsy was the page that became the final step of Hoamsy’s user onboarding process. My job on this project was to streamline data collection as much as possible during onboarding in order to increase user retention. </p>

          <h3>Native Messenger</h3>
          <p>On this project, I was in charge of incorporating a rich text editor into Hoamsy’s native messaging system. ‍The goal was to allow users to be able to send and receive links from one another, as well as format their text if they chose to do so, and I was able to accomplish this goal by ultilizng npm packages.</p>
