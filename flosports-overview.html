        <h3>Job Overview</h3>
        <p>
          FloSports has provided me invaluable experience as I get to build digital products that users love. I have worked on many projects at FloSports ranging from building data-rich sports results experiences, to helping implement brand new, platform-wide payments and navigation architectures. Below are a just a few personal favorite projects that I have gotten to work on during my time at FloSports:

          <h3>Results Tables</h3>
          <p>My first project at FloSports was implementing a redesign of the cheer results experience. My role on this project was to help design our data mapping functionality for incoming cheer results and translate that data into a data-rich frontend user experience. I gained vital experience working with very large data sets and developing UIs with Angular. As a result, this project increased the YOY pageviews of the entire site by nearly 50%, and is a page that continues to generate millions of page views for the company each year.</p>

          <h3>Global Navigation</h3>
          <p>As FloSports began to shift its focus towards leveraging the wealth of sports data at its disposal, it became glaringly evident that priority number one would be designing and developing a new platform-wide global navigation system to lead users more seamlessly to the data they wished to access. Much like the revamped results experience, I was in charge of mapping API data to the necessary custom Typescript types, and consuming that data on the app's frontend to create this new, cohesive, data-driven navigation experience that completely modernized how the company is able to serve content to its users.</p>

          <h3>Payments System</h3>
          <p>This is one of the most defining and large-scale projects I have worked on to date as a developer. This project involved implementing brand new micro-systems to handle user subscription events and payment processes. This provided the company never-before-seen flexibility with their pricing systems, and allowed for all new pricing methods such as pay-per-view, tier-based subscriptions, and more to be leveraged. My role on this project was to help design and implement the front-end payments architecture to utilize and consume these newly created payments and subscription services.</p>
